# Book Management System

This is a simple Book Management System implemented in Go (Golang). It provides RESTful API endpoints to manage books such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting book entries. The system utilizes Gorilla Mux for routing and GORM as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for working with the MySQL database.
